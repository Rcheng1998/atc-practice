## 🌐 GitHub Pages Setup

This repository is configured to be hosted on GitHub Pages. Follow these steps to enable it:

### Steps to Enable GitHub Pages:

1. **Merge this PR** to the `main` or `master` branch
2. Go to your repository **Settings** → **Pages**
3. Under **Source**, select **"GitHub Actions"**
4. The workflow will automatically deploy your site

### 🔗 Your Site URL:

Once deployed, your site will be available at:
```
https://rcheng1998.github.io/atc-practice/
```

### 📝 How It Works:

- The `index.html` file is automatically served as the homepage
- The `.github/workflows/pages.yml` workflow handles automatic deployment
- Any push to the main/master branch will trigger a new deployment

### 🛠️ Local Development:

To test locally, simply open `index.html` in your web browser.

Note: The background image (`Downloads/aa.jpg`) is referenced in the HTML but not included in the repository. You may want to add it or remove the reference.
